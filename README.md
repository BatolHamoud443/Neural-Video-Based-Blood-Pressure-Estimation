## 🩺 Overview

This repository contains the **codebase** used for experiments in our research article on: **Neural Network Model Combination for Video-Based Blood Pressure Estimation: New Approach and Evaluation** 

Our study introduces a novel method for estimating **systolic and diastolic blood pressure** from the **RGB color intensity variations** in facial skin regions. These variations correspond to blood flow patterns and are captured using an ordinary camera. Using **hybrid deep learning models**, our goal is to enable accessible, non-invasive blood pressure monitoring using only video input—eliminating the need for traditional, cumbersome, or expensive equipment.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The dataset used in this research is **confidential** and cannot be shared. This repository includes the **full code** for data preprocessing, model training/testing, and evaluation, but **no actual data** is provided.


## 🧠 Key Features

- End-to-end pipeline for **video-based blood pressure estimation**
